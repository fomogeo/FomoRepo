      "file_text": "# AUTOMATIC PRODUCT UPDATES GUIDE\n\nYour FOMO Deals Platform now has **automatic product updating** built-in! This guide explains how to set it up.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf What Gets Automated\n\n\u2705 **Daily Product Updates** - Fetches top products from affiliate networks  \n\u2705 **Daily Price Updates** - Checks current prices, detects price drops  \n\u2705 **Daily Trending Refresh** - Updates which products show as \"trending\"  \n\u2705 **Automatic Deal Expiration** - Removes old/unavailable products  \n\u2705 **Price Drop Notifications** - Alerts subscribers to big discounts  \n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Setup Options\n\nYou have **3 options** for automation, from easiest to most powerful:\n\n### Option 1: CSV Import (Easiest - FREE)\n**Best for**: Beginners, low maintenance  \n**Cost**: $0  \n**Time**: 15 minutes weekly  \n\n### Option 2: Cron Jobs (Moderate - FREE)  \n**Best for**: Automated but no API costs  \n**Cost**: $0  \n**Time**: 1 hour setup, then automatic  \n\n### Option 3: Full API Integration (Advanced - PAID)  \n**Best for**: Maximum automation, real-time updates  \n**Cost**: $20-50/month  \n**Time**: 2 hours setup, then fully automatic  \n\n---\n\n## Option 1: CSV Import (Recommended to Start)\n\n### How It Works\n1. Download product feeds from affiliate networks (weekly)\n2. Run a simple import script\n3. Products update automatically\n\n### Step-by-Step Setup\n\n#### 1. Download Product Feeds\n\n**Amazon Associates:**\n- Log in to Amazon Associates\n- Tools \u2192 Product Links \u2192 \"Download Product Links\"\n- Save as CSV\n\n**Awin:**\n- Log in to Awin\n- Publishers \u2192 Product Feeds\n- Download your approved merchant feeds\n- Save as CSV\n\n**ShareASale:**\n- Log in to ShareASale\n- Tools \u2192 Datafeed Services\n- Download merchant product feeds\n- Save as CSV\n\n#### 2. Prepare the CSV\n\nCreate a folder in your project:\n```bash\nmkdir scripts/feeds\n```\n\nPlace your CSV files there:\n```\nscripts/feeds/amazon-products.csv\nscripts/feeds/awin-products.csv\nscripts/feeds/shareasale-products.csv\n```\n\n#### 3. Run the Import Script\n\n**Install dependencies** (first time only):\n```bash\nnpm install dotenv @supabase/supabase-js\n```\n\n**Import products:**\n```bash\n# Amazon\nnode scripts/import-csv.js amazon-products.csv amazon amazon US\n\n# Awin\nnode scripts/import-csv.js awin-products.csv awin awin UK\n\n# ShareASale\nnode scripts/import-csv.js shareasale-products.csv shareasale shareasale US\n```\n\n**That's it!** Products are now in your database.\n\n#### 4. Schedule Weekly Updates\n\n**Option A: Windows Task Scheduler**\n1. Open Task Scheduler\n2. Create Basic Task\n3. Set trigger: Weekly, Monday 9 AM\n4. Action: Start a program\n5. Program: `node`\n6. Arguments: `C:\\path\\to\\scripts\\import-csv.js amazon-products.csv amazon amazon`\n\n**Option B: Mac/Linux Cron**\n1. Edit crontab: `crontab -e`\n2.

      "file_text": "# \ud83e\udd16 AUTOMATION FEATURES ADDED!\n\n## \u2705 Your Request: Automatic Product Updates\n\nYou asked for **automatic daily/weekly updates of top products** from all affiliate networks.\n\n**I've now added complete automation!** Your platform can now update products automatically without any manual intervention.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 What's New\n\n### 1. Automatic Product Import (3 Methods)\n\n#### \u2728 Method 1: CSV Import (Easiest - FREE)\n- Download product feeds from affiliate networks\n- Run one command to import hundreds of products\n- Schedule weekly updates with Task Scheduler/Cron\n- **Script**: `scripts/import-csv.js`\n- **Time**: 15 minutes/week\n\n#### \u26a1 Method 2: Scheduled Cron Jobs (FREE to $20/month)\n- Automatic daily product updates\n- Automatic price monitoring\n- Automatic trending product refresh\n- **API Routes**: \n  - `/api/cron/update-products` - Daily at 6 AM\n  - `/api/cron/update-prices` - Daily at 3 AM\n  - `/api/cron/refresh-trending` - Daily at midnight\n\n#### \ud83d\udd25 Method 3: Full API Integration (Most Powerful - $30-50/month)\n- Direct connection to affiliate network APIs\n- Real-time price updates\n- Instant price drop detection\n- 100% automated, zero manual work\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb New Files Added\n\n### Automation Scripts\n```\n/app/api/cron/update-products/route.ts   - Auto-fetch products from APIs\n/app/api/cron/update-prices/route.ts     - Auto-update prices daily\n/app/api/cron/refresh-trending/route.ts  - Auto-refresh trending products\n/scripts/import-csv.js                    - Bulk CSV import tool\n/scripts/feeds/                           - Folder for product CSVs\n```\n\n### Documentation\n```\nAUTOMATION_SETUP.md  - Complete automation setup guide\n```\n\n### Configuration\n```\nvercel.json          - Updated with cron schedules\n.env.example         - Added API keys for automation\npackage.json         - Added CSV import script\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf How It Works\n\n### Automatic Product Updates\n\n**Every day at 6 AM:**\n1. System fetches top products from:\n   - Amazon (Best Sellers)\n   - Awin (Product feeds)\n   - CJ Affiliate (Catalog)\n   - Impact (API)\n   - ShareASale (Feeds)\n2. Adds new products automatically\n3. Updates existing products\n4. Adds affiliate links for each country\n\n**Result**: Fresh products daily, zero manual work\n\n### Automatic Price Updates\n\n**Every day at 3 AM:**\n1. Checks current price for each product\n2. Updates if price changed\n3. Detects price drops\n4. Marks price drops as \"Trending\"\n5. Sends email alerts for big discounts (20%+)\n\n**Result**: Always accurate prices, never miss a deal\n\n### Automatic Trending Refresh\n\n**Every night at midnight:**\n1. Analyzes product performance:\n   - Click-through rates\n   - Recent views\n   - Affiliate clicks\n   - Discount percentages\n2. Calculates trending scores\n3. Updates \"Trending Now\" section\n4. Ensures category diversity\n\n**Result**: Your trending section always shows truly popular products\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfae Quick Start Options\n\n### Option A: Start Simple (Recommended)\n1. Download product feeds from Amazon (CSV)\n2. Run: `npm run import-csv amazon-products.csv amazon amazon US`\n3. Products appear on your site instantly\n4. Repeat weekly (15 minutes)\n\n### Option B: Semi-Automated\n1. Set up free cron service (cron-job.org)\n2. Point it at your API endpoints\n3. Products update automatically daily\n4. No manual work needed\n\n### Option C: Full Automation\n1. Get API keys from affiliate networks\n2. Add to environment variables\n3. Deploy with Vercel Cron\n4.
